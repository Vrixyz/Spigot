BUGS / HACKS:

  WEB:
    - assets/javascripts/application.js can't have "//= require_tree .", I removed to make it work but I don't really understand why... It seems to come from misunderstood coffee scripts.
    - capybara 2.0 ambiguous password fixed with a hack (find method)



TODO:
  
  WEB:
    - CV
    - Portfolio
    - Database
    - Games
    - Launcher
    - Forum

MAYBES:
  - Jekyll library for static pages
  - Turbulenz for html5 games (looks very promising)
